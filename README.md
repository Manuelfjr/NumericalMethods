Repository with implementation of numerical methods

## FirstTest

This material contains a class with root estimation methods.

## Usage
$ X \sim $
- .plot(f, xmin, xmax)

**xmin and xmax:** x-axis range limits, with 50 points being generated

**f :** function of interest for plotting

- .bis(a, b, f)

Also known as binary truncation, or Bolzano method, suppose the interval _**a**_ and _**b**_ contains a single root for _**f(x) = 0**_
